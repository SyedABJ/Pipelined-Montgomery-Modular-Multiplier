# Pipelined-Montgomery-Modular-Multiplier
This repo contains all the verilog code i wrote and executed during my summer research internship at IIIT Bangalore (Intelligent Hardware Systems Lab).
The top module implements a 6 bit Montgomery Multiplier which can be scaled easily to handle large integers for cryptographic applications like Homomorphic Encryption.
Functional verification was carried out using Vivado's Virtual Input/Output (VIO) and Integrated Logic Analyzer (ILA).
